# ShieldOps Pitch Deck Outline

## Slide 1: Title
**ShieldOps** — Autonomous AI Agents for SRE Operations
*"Your infrastructure never sleeps. Neither should its intelligence."*

## Slide 2: Problem
- 70% of enterprises lack DevSecOps expertise
- SRE teams handle 50+ alerts/day manually — MTTR averages 2+ hours
- Alert fatigue → burnout → incidents missed → revenue impact
- Multi-cloud complexity growing 3x faster than team capacity
- **$2.5M average cost per hour of downtime** (enterprise)

## Slide 3: Solution
ShieldOps deploys autonomous AI agents that:
- **Investigate** incidents (root cause in minutes, not hours)
- **Remediate** infrastructure issues (restart, scale, patch, rollback)
- **Enforce** security policies continuously (CVE patching, compliance)
- **Learn** from every incident to improve over time

## Slide 4: Demo / Product
Live demo showing:
1. Alert fires → Agent investigates autonomously
2. Root cause identified with confidence score + evidence chain
3. Remediation executed with policy-gated approval
4. Dashboard shows full reasoning and rollback capability

## Slide 5: Differentiation
| | ShieldOps | Datadog AI | SRE.ai | Rootly |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Executes Remediations | Yes | No | No | No |
| Multi-Cloud + On-Prem | Yes | No | Partial | No |
| Security-First | Yes | Add-on | Limited | No |
| Transparent Reasoning | Yes | Limited | Limited | Yes |

*"We don't just analyze. We act."*
