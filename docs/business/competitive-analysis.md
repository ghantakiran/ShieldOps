## Positioning Summary

### Where We Win
1. **Multi-cloud + on-prem environments** — No competitor does this well
2. **Autonomous execution** — Everyone else is analysis-only
3. **Security-first architecture** — Built-in, not bolted-on
4. **Transparent reasoning** — Full audit trail for compliance

### Where We Need to Catch Up
1. **Brand recognition** — Incumbents have 10+ years of market presence
2. **Integration breadth** — Need to match Datadog/New Relic ecosystem
3. **Enterprise references** — Need 3-5 marquee logos

### Defensibility Moats (Over Time)
1. **Multi-environment data network effects** — More environments → better agent models
2. **Remediation playbook library** — Growing library of validated fixes
3. **Compliance framework coverage** — SOC2/PCI/HIPAA packs take months to build
4. **Customer switching costs** — Deep integration into infrastructure workflows
